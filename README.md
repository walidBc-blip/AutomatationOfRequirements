 üìÑ Description

Automating Requirement Classification is a powerful tool designed to help users classify software requirements efficiently and accurately using multiple Language Models (LLMs). The primary objective of this program is to process a list of requirements from a text file, classify them into functional or non-functional requirements, and further categorize them based on specific criteria to enhance project management and development processes.

# üîç Key Features

1. Classification of Requirements:
   - Functional Requirements: 
     - Primary Requirements: Core functionalities essential to the system.
     - Secondary Requirements: Additional functionalities supporting the primary ones.
     - UserTask Requirements: Requirements focused on user interactions and tasks.
     - SystemTask Requirements: Requirements centered around system operations and processes.
   
   - Non-Functional Requirements: 
     - Quality Attributes: Attributes that define the system's operation, such as performance, security, usability, and reliability.

2. Detailed Categorization:
   - Mapping Quality Attributes: Associates secondary functional requirements with relevant quality attributes to ensure comprehensive system design and implementation.

3. Efficiency and Accuracy:
   - Utilizes advanced LLMs to ensure precise classification and categorization, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors.

 üõ† Installation
